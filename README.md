# ASP.NET-CORE-MVC-SQL---Shop-movies-based-on-books
ASP.NET CORE MVC PROJECT In this project I built a movie store based on books where you can buy movies as a customer, add a comment, edit the customer account and see the shopping list. On the admin side you can add a product with a description and an image file - you can edit a product and delete it. Beyond that there is a list of customers and their accounts and how much they bought.
